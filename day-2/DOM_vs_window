Introduction:
In JavaScript, the Document and Window objects play crucial roles in manipulating web pages and handling interactions with the browser. While they are related and interconnected, it's important to understand the differences between these objects to leverage their unique features effectively. In this blog post, we'll explore the distinctions between the Document and Window objects, their respective properties and methods, and how they contribute to web development.

Overview of the Document Object:
The Document object represents the web page loaded in the browser and provides access to the page's elements, content, and structure. It serves as an interface to interact with the document's DOM (Document Object Model). Key characteristics of the Document object include:

1. Accessing Elements: The Document object provides methods to access and manipulate elements within the web page, such as `getElementById()`, `getElementsByClassName()`, and `getElementsByTagName()`. These methods allow developers to retrieve specific elements based on their IDs, classes, or tags.

2. Modifying Content: Through the Document object, you can dynamically modify the content of the web page. You can create new elements, add or remove elements, change element attributes, and manipulate the text or HTML content within elements.

3. Styling and CSS: The Document object enables you to access and modify the CSS styles applied to elements. You can add or remove CSS classes, modify inline styles, and change the appearance of elements dynamically.

4. Events: The Document object allows you to handle events that occur within the document, such as mouse clicks, keyboard interactions, or form submissions. You can attach event listeners to elements and respond to user actions.

Overview of the Window Object:
The Window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page. It provides an interface to interact with the browser itself and manage aspects beyond the document's content. Key characteristics of the Window object include:

1. Global Scope: The Window object serves as the global object in JavaScript. Variables and functions defined in the global scope become properties and methods of the Window object, accessible throughout the page.

2. Navigation and Location: The Window object allows you to control the browser's navigation and manipulate the URL of the current web page. You can redirect the user to another page, reload the current page, or access information about the URL through the `location` property.

3. Timing and Timers: The Window object provides methods to handle timing-related tasks. It allows you to schedule functions to run after a specified delay using methods like `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`. You can also cancel scheduled tasks using the respective `clearTimeout()` and `clearInterval()` methods.

4. Child Windows and Frames: The Window object facilitates interaction with child windows or frames within the browser window. You can access and manipulate the content and properties of child windows using methods like `open()` or `postMessage()`.
